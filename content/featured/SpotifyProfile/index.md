Eco Reward is a sustainability app that **rewards users for recycling**. By returning recyclables to registered stations, users **earn points** that can be redeemed for **eco-friendly products** or **donations to environmental causes**. The app also features 'Jack', an **AI-powered assistant** providing personalized tips for reducing carbon emissions. Built using **React Native** and **Firebase** with **OpenAI** integration, Eco Reward was developed as my team's submission for **MHacks 2024**, aiming to make sustainable living easy and rewarding.
