An **AI-driven fitness app** that provides real-time feedback on exercise form by analyzing **user-uploaded videos**. Using **Computer Vision**, it aims to offer accessible, on-demand form correction to reduce reliance on personal trainers. Built with **React Native** and **Firebase**, the app includes **user authentication**, **video capture**, and **ML integration**. Currently part of my university's **AI Club Advanced Projects**
