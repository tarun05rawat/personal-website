An AI-driven chatbot that answers questions about professors using a custom dataset and a Pinecone vector database. Using **Retreieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques, **Pinecone**, **JSON**, and **OpenAI**, the chatbot provides detailed responses and insights. Currently working on integrating with the **Rate My Professor API** for real-time data.
