TickMate is a simple web application that allows **users to add, delete, and mark tasks** as completed. Built with **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**, it uses the browser's local storage to ensure tasks persist even **after refreshing the page**. The app is deployed via **Vercel** and offers a user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks. Users can interact with tasks by clicking to mark them as completed or deleting them via an "Ã—" button.
