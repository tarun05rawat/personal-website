The **BreezeWatch** app is a simple **weather application** that allows users to search for real-time weather conditions by city name. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **OpenWeatherMap API**, it displays key weather information such as city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and appropriate weather icons.
