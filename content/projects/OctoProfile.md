The Image Search Engine is a web app that allows users to search for images using the Unsplash API. Users can input search terms to view image results, which can be opened in a new tab. The app includes a "Show More" button to load additional images. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a simple yet effective interface for image searches.
